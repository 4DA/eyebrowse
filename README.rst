About
-----

``eyebrowse`` is a global minor mode for Emacs that allows you to manage
your window configurations in a simple manner.  It displays their
current state in the modeline by default.  The behaviour is modeled
after `ranger <http://ranger.nongnu.org/>`_, a file manager written in
Python.

Installation
------------

For now installation is only supported via `quelpa
<https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa>`_.  Use ``M-: (quelpa '(eyebrowse
:fetcher bitbucket :repo "wasamasa/eyebrowse"))`` and you should be
good to go.  Installation via MELPA will be supported eventually, too.

Usage

Name
----

Actually, I wanted to name this mode "eyebrows" for no real reason,
but then a silly typo happened.  The typo stuck.  So did the new name.
