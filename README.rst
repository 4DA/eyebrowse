About
-----

``eyebrowse`` is a global minor mode for Emacs that allows you to manage
your window configurations in a simple manner.  It displays their
current state in the modeline by default.  The behaviour is modeled
after ```ranger`` <http://ranger.nongnu.org/>`_, a file manager written in
Python.

Name

Actually, I wanted to name this mode "eyebrows", but then a silly typo
happened.  The typo stuck.  So did the new name.
